# MachineLearningProjects

In this repository there are some samples for supervised models like Regression and Classification, some others for unsupervised models like Clustering. Also, I include some examples of Recommendation Systems. 

In the directory "Projects", there are some personal projects using Machine Learning: first of them is a Gaussian Classifier used to predict if a patient will have diabetes or no, and second corresponds to the final project for the "Machine Learning with Python" - IBM Course, and consists on the implementation of K-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression Algoritnms to predict if a loan will be paid off or not.
